# Asteroid-classification-using-knn
Asteroid classification plays a crucial role in understanding these celestial bodies and their potential impact on Earth. The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model using the k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN) algorithm to classify asteroids into different classes based on their attributes.
